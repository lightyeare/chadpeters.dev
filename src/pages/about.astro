    <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Chad</strong>. I'm a software engineer mostly in the Microsoft stack now. I live in Central "Penn's Woods." I've been doing the software thing for <i>a while</i> - my first full-time job was Y2k changes on a mainframe. The first code I wrote was on my Commodore 128, and the first code I was paid to write was Visual FoxPro. Most of that time I've been privileged to be part of the incredible <a href="https://rimdev.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RIMdev</a> team.</p>
    <p>You can see some of my work on <a href="https://github.com/lightyeare?tab=repositories&q=&type=public&language=&sort=stargazers" target="_blank">GitHub</a> with more to come.</p>
    <p>Contact me at <a href="mailto:hello@chadpeters.dev">hello@chadpeters.dev</a> or on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chad-peters-80a55317b" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
    <p>If you'd like to take a peek at some of what I have been learning in the Microsoft ecosystem, visit my <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/chadpeters-7551/" target="_blank">Microsoft Learn profile</a>.</p>
