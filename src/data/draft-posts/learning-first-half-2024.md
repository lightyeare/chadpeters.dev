Our company was aquired in 2022. The next year our first annual review with the new company involved self evaluation for the previous year. This was a departure from what we had been used to doing pre-aquisition which was to basically just show up for a "review" with your manager. 

I got kinda frustrated 😤. Why was there no heads up when we were acquired that htis was going to be a requirement? How in the world was I supposed to remember all the things I did the previous year? After that review in 2023 I immediately started a journal to log all of the things I was doing as I was doing them that year. I felt much better going into the annual review in 2024. 

In preparing for the 2024 review, I realized no one was going to care about my career except me. 

At this point, I'm a little more than half way through my career. It's taken me an embarrasingly long time to realize that no one is going to care about my career if I don't. I've had a great job with a great team but I have been coasting. 

This year I started seeking out resources for growth in my software engineering career. I've been at a job I really enjoy with an absolutely fantastic company, but I've grown pretty fat and happy. This year, though, I had a bit of a rude awakening. 

> No one is going to care about your career if you don't. 

There is a lot to unpackage there, but that is not what I want to do here. Maybe some day. Instead, I wanted to create a quick summary of some of the things I've learned so far this year as it relates to career growth for software engineering. 

I've been pleasantly suprised by how many resources I've been able to find. So, so many. I'm still trying to sort out which ones are most valuable. Trying not to let FOMO freeze me. 

I started writing a summary of the articles I've really connected with and have found most useful. Besides the obvious benefit of being able to find them later, it is also helping me sort through the resources I am currently following. If they keep showing up in the summary, I'll keep following, otherwise I'll find new ones. 

I'll present the topic and a link to the original blog. Some of my notes might be direct copies of text from the authors. I'm not trying to make anyone think that these are my own ideas 😄 If you find one that resonates with you, follow the link to read the whole article. 

#### Building trust as a software engineer

[https://graphite.dev/blog/trust](https://graphite.dev/blog/trust)

> To be a senior engineer is to cultivate and maintain trust.

- Trust is the belief, that given a new situation, someone will deliver. Trusting that if you put someone in a situation where there’s a risk of failure, they’ll either navigate through the complexity and deliver, or they’ll provide direct, immediate feedback that something about the project needs to be rescoped so that success is possible.
- Building trust is creating a streak of continuously living up to expectations and promises.  
- Dependability is more valuable on an engineering team than unreliable excellence.

#### Guide to leading meetings as a software engineer

[https://read.highgrowthengineer.com/p/guide-to-leading-meetings-as-a-software](https://read.highgrowthengineer.com/p/guide-to-leading-meetings-as-a-software)

> In this article, you’ll learn actionable tips that will make you seen as a top-notch meeting leader and open you up to bigger opportunities.

This article doesn't lend itself to a summary but rather is included here as a resource. While the article makes the big claim above, I can share a related personal anecdote. 

After reading this I implemented some of the suggestions in a meeting invite that I sent out. Prior to this, I've never seen more than a sentence or two in a meeting invite description. Nobody hailed me as a hero, but the next meeting invite I received from our project manager I almost fell out of my chair! Not only had she used the same format that I had, but she improved it! 👏🏻 This led to a conversation about how we could work together to positively change the culture of our organization. That was a really big win for me, and gave me momentum to continue to share what I was learning. 

#### How to lead projects from start to finish as a software engineer

[https://read.highgrowthengineer.com/p/how-to-lead-projects-from-start-to](https://read.highgrowthengineer.com/p/how-to-lead-projects-from-start-to)

> The best engineers don't just know how to code. They know how to bring people together and deliver value.

Again, not an article that lends itself to summary. This is the 2nd resource I am including from [Jordan Cutler](https://substack.com/@jordancutler). After I read this article, I went ahead and subscribed to his Substack. He seems to be a very good fit for where I am at and I found he had a lot of answers for questions that I had. He writes about where I want to be soon so it's seems like a great investment for my career. 

#### Nervous about Q&As? 7 Essential tips to answer confidently.

> I wish someone had given me these 7 tips early in my career. It would have accelerated my ability to answer questions like a leader.

1. Fix your attitude - it's ok to get nervous or not know everything. Figure out why you are nervous. 2nd, be approachable when answering questions. Body language should invite questions.

2. Silence is your friend - use silence to structure your response

3. Don't answer vague questions - if you are in doubt you understood the question, paraphrase it. Ask follow up questions for clarity. 

4. Take it offline - if some questions are intricate or nuanced, provide a 1 line answer and offer to follow up later. It should be a satisfactory 1 liner that justifies follow up.

5. Reframe the question - Some people ask provoking or blunt questions to which a yes / no answer can invite trouble. You need to know how to reframe the question.

6. Handling complaints - Handle complaints masquerading as questions by silence + follow up question. Don't get bullied into a meaningless debate. Instead, focus on how it impacts them, why they care, and the next steps. This approach helps you convert complaints into questions or requests.

7. Share the core message first - In most cases, you should share the core message first. It helps orient the answer.

I have a leadership position in an organization outside of my employment. I am occasionally asked to be in a role to answer questions that are posed publically. This was very helpful for me going in to the last occurance. I also read through this again and thought about how I could have handled my responses to some of the questions in a better way.
