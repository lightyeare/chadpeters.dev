description: What's the 'best' way to remove a file extension from a file path string?

_I originally published this on the [RIMdev Blog](https://rimdev.io/remove-file-extension-from-string)_

This week I was working on a project that moves and archives file recordings and their accompanying XML meta data. I needed to remove the file extension from a file path stored as a string. The first thing I thought of was:

```csharp
filename.Replace(".xml","")
```

That works, but it has to march through the whole string to the end to find what it needs to replace. 

Substring seems more efficient:

```csharp
filename.Substring(0, filename.Length - 4);
```

My Lead then reminded me that `Path` has a method for this very thing:

```csharp
Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(filename)
```

At this point curiosity got the better of me. Which of these is _actually_ more efficient? More importantly, which of these is more efficient for the strings I am working with? [BenchmarkDotNet](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet) ftw! ðŸŽ‰

![Benchmark Results](/assets/blog/remove-file-extensions/removeextensionbenchmark.jpg)
_Fwiw, the strings I am working with are the 2nd result set with a length pretty close to 71._

The fact that `Replace` was the worst performing isn't a surprise, but there were a few surprises. I was surprised that the difference between `Replace` and `Substring` decreased as the size of the string got larger. `Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension` had a couple of interesting finds. Once the string gets to a certain length the performance and allocated memory remains consistent no matter the length of the string. It also uses significantly less memory than the other two methods. 

I looked at the `Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension` and in short it:
- converts the path string to a `ReadOnlySpan<char>`
- gets just the filename from the path
- uses `LastIndexOf(".")` to find the period before the extension
- uses `Slice` to get the filename without the extension
- converts the filename without the extension back to a string

I found this paragraph in an [article exploring spans](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2018/january/csharp-all-about-span-exploring-a-new-net-mainstay) that gives an example of when you might want to use a span. It helps shed light on the benchmark results. 

> Or take another example. Youâ€™re implementing an operation over System.String, such as a specialized parsing method. Youâ€™d likely expose a method that takes a string and provide an implementation that operates on strings. But what if you wanted to support operating over a subset of that string? String.Substring could be used to carve out just the piece thatâ€™s interesting to them, but thatâ€™s a relatively expensive operation, involving a string allocation and memory copy. You could, as mentioned in the array example, take an offset and a count, but then what if the caller doesnâ€™t have a string but instead has a char[]? Or what if the caller has a char*, like one they created with stackalloc to use some space on the stack, or as the result of a call to native code? How could you write your parsing method in a way that didnâ€™t force the caller to do any allocations or copies, and yet worked equally well with inputs of type string, char[] and char*?

That was a fun diversion and an informative peek under the hood. Happy coding!
