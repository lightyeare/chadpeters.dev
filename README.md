Hi, I'm **Chad**. I'm a software engineer in the Microsoft stack, and based in central "Penn's Woods." I've been doing that for _a while_ (my first full-time software job was Y2k changes on a mainframe), and most of that time I've been privileged to be part of the incredible [RIMdev]("https://rimdev.io") team.

You can see some of my work on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/lightyeare) with more to come.

See my about page for my contact information.
