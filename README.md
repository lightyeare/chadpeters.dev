<p>Hi, I'm <strong>Chad</strong>. I'm a software engineer in the Microsoft stack, and based in Central "Penn's Woods." I've been doing that for <i>a while</i> (my first full-time software job was Y2k changes on a mainframe), and most of that time I've been privileged to be part of the incredible <a href="https://rimdev.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RIMdev</a> team.</p>
    <p>You can see some of my work on <a href="https://www.github.com/lightyeare" target="_blank">GitHub</a> with more to come.</p>
